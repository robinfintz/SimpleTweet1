## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The main challenges I encountered were with connecting to the Twitter API, resolving issues with the rate limit, and fixing the UI. In regards to the API, as a new Twitter user I had no feed, though I soon realized this was because I was not following anyone; I assumed I had an error since my JSON Array was empty. Once I had the app functioning, after running it a few times consecutively, I encountered a rate limit error, though I realized this is a general issue with using the API. Lastly, I had some difficulties in attempting to add the Twitter icon to the action bar.
